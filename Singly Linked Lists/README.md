## Linked Lists

A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head points to NULL.

Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:

- A Data Item (we can store integer, strings or any type of data).
- Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node (connects one node to another) or An address of another node

Different functions available are:

- Creation of linked list
- Traversal of linked list
- Insertion in linked list
  1. Insertion at beginning
  2. Insertion at end
  3. Inserting between 2 data nodes
- Deletion in linked list
