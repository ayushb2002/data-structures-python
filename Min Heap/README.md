### A Min Heap is a Complete Binary Tree. A Min heap is typically represented as an array. The root element will be at Arr[0]. For any ith node, i.e., Arr[i]:

- Arr[(i -1) / 2] returns its parent node.
- Arr[(2 * i) + 1] returns its left child node.
- Arr[(2 * i) + 2] returns its right child node.

#### Operations on Min Heap :

- getMin(): It returns the root element of Min Heap. Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).
- extractMin(): Removes the minimum element from MinHeap. Time Complexity of this Operation is O(Log n) as this operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling heapify()) after removing root.
- insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree. If new key is larger than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.
